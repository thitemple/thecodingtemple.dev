summary:
  So, I gave this talk at React Ottawa, and it was all about using TypeScript
  and functional programming to make our code intentions crystal clear. The goal
  was to make our lives and our buddies' lives easier when we revisit that code
  later on.

[React Ottawa](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-ReactJS-Meetup/events/270442672/).
The talk is (was) about how to use TypeScript and functional programming
practices to better communicate what is the real intentions of the of the code
we are writing with the goal of making our lives and of our peers easier when
reading that code after a while.

TypeScript_ and you
