The past Thursday I gave a talk at a local React meetup called
[Ottawa ReactJS](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-ReactJS-Meetup/). The talk was
about how to use Fable, Elmish and F# for a more reliable React application.

The title of the talk was _Reliable React With F#_ and you the we
[can check out the slides if you'd like](/reliable-react-with-fsharp).

The code used for the presentation
[can be seen here](https://github.com/thitemple/real-world-fable) and there's
also a [live demo available](https://real-world-fable.netlify.com/).
