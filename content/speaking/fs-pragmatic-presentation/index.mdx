The past Thursday I gave a talk at a local functional programming meetup called
[Lambda Nights](https://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Nights/). The talk was about F#
and how I believe that it's a viable choice as a main programming language to
solve all sorts of problems.

The title of the talk was _F# - Where Functional Programming Meets Pragmatic_
and you the we
[can check out the slides if you'd like](/fs-pragmatic-presentation).
