First, let me give you some context, and bear with me for a moment, I'll make a
point.

I'm a basketball fan, I love watching NBA games and most of all, I'm an
[Orlando Magic](www.orlandomagic.com) fan. Talking about the Orlando Magic, in
2009 the team went to the NBA finals and lost. After that, the team was not able
to get back to the finals and eventually in 2012 it traded its superstar and
entered in rebuilding mode. The three seasons after the trade were all about
acquiring young talented players, getting some experience, and also, the team
lost a lot of games. Actually it was the team that lost the most during those
three seasons.

Now enter the 2015-2016 season and with it a new coach (Scott Skiles). One of
the main reasons advertised for changing coaches is because they don't want that
the young team gets used to losing. For the past three years, one thinks we
always heard after a loss was: "we lost, but we're young and we're learning".

That's true, they're young and they're learning, but management is paying for
them to learn and fans are paying for tickets, merchandising, etc. And, the fear
is that the excuse or culture of losing would become a habit and they don't want
that. After all, a team is not just a team is a business.

As a fan (and I am really a fan), I understand the rebuilding process and that
it takes time, but after a while I got tired and frustrated with that. And, also
I don't want to talk to friends about how my team is losing, but learning a lot
in the process.

I want to see my team **win**, I want to see them being great at playing
basketball so I'll be entertained.

If, by any chance you're a fan of some sort of sport, be that basketball,
soccer, hockey or whatever and you're a fan of a team, I'm pretty sure you
understand what I'm saying.

Now take a look at the first 2 minutes and 20 seconds from this video from a few
days ago, where coach Scott Skiles talks about his team.

Imagine you as a fan of this team, don't you love this guy, pushing his players
to get better and also holding them accountable for their interest, or lack of
interest? Yeah, I want to see my team playing their best players, the ones that
are really trying to bring a win back home.

Now, he's talking about character, he's talking about guys working and working
hard to get better. He's also talking about having high standards, so they're
trying to win the game and if you're sluggish he's going to look somewhere else
to try to win that game.

Yeah, I love to hear that from the coach of my team!!

But wait a minute and here's where I start to make my point. Those players,
they're not just "players", they're professionals. Yeah, sure, they're
professional players, but then again they're professionals. And, we as fans of a
team, want them to be better so our team can win.

Now as fans, we can consider ourselves clients of that team because in some way
we're giving them money, may that be by buying tickets, by buying merchandise or
by watching the game on TV.

So here I am asking myself and you, what is the difference? Don't we all have to
try to be better professionals? Don't our clients have the right to expect that
we will work hard to be better and win the game for them?

By the way, professionals have to practice to get better. They don't get better
just by showing to the game. In the same way, we cannot expect to get better
only when we're shipping code to production, we have to practice.

One last question, should we be sent to the bench because we're not performing
very well?
