Lately I was made aware by my colleagues that I begin a lot of sentences with the phrase "I was listening to a podcast..." and that is true. I listen to a lot of podcasts.

I have shared my [podcast playlist](/blog/2015/10/06/whats-on-my-playlist-podcasts-i-listen-to) before, but that list has shifted a little bit, so here's my updated list as of the summer of 2018 in no particular order but grouped by subject - kind of.

## Tech

-   [Elm Town](https://www.elmtown.audio/) - A very good source for those interested in the Elm language
-   [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/) - Every episode a different person who does functional programming is interviewed in this show.
-   [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/) - Not always technical, and when technical it's about a wide range of subjects, in any case it's always very interesting.
-   [LambdaCast](https://lambdacast.com) - Great for those beginning with functional programming, and if that's the case, it's worth listening from the beginning.
-   [Rework](https://rework.fm/) - From the Basecamp company, who produce a [highly recommended book of the same title](https://amzn.to/2LEsFuo), it's a podcast about the business of running a tech company.
-   [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) - All around web development.
-   [Three Devs and a Maybe](http://threedevsandamaybe.com/) - Different subjects on development. Very entertaining.
-   [WTF#](https://wtfsharp.net/) - It's not updated very often but if you are interested in the F# language

## News and varieties

-   [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/) - Well, it's the podcast about the hidden side of everything.
-   [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) - Economics for people who are not expert in the subject.
-   [Science Vs](https://www.gimletmedia.com/science-vs/) - Each episode is a subject being explored in the eyes of science.
-   [TED Radio Hour](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour) - You know TED right?

## Entertainment

-   [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
-   [Gugacast](https://gugacast.com/) - This is the funniest one I listen to but it's in Portuguese.
-   [NerdCast](https://jovemnerd.com.br/nerdcast/) - For years, this was considered the best podcast in Brazil. I've been listening to it for about a decade.

## Board games

I love board games, I buy a lot of them so here are a couple on the subject.

-   [The Dice Tower](http://www.dicetower.com/game-podcast/dice-tower)
-   [The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast](http://www.thesecretcabal.com/)

## Sports

I am a fan of the NBA and specially of the [Orlando Magic](http://orlandomagic.com), so here's what I listen to keep up to date with that.

-   [Do You Believe in Magic](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/do-you-believe-in-magic/)
