I have to admit it, I have a serious condition called CPA, AKA Chronicle Podcasts Addiction, at least I diagnostic myself with that condition.

Yeap, I definitely subscribe to a lot of podcasts. I've just counted my subscription list, 21. Yes, I subscribe to 21 and I think it's a lot.

I listen to different podcasts on different subjects and so, here I am sharing what I listen to with you.

## The technical ones:

-   [This Developer's Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) - This is definitely one of my favorites, a very well produced and interview styled podcast. The episodes are not that frequent and not that technical for that matter, but they're certainly worth waiting for.
-   [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) - If you are a JavaScript developer this is a must, a lot of different topics on JavaScript. Great if you want to know more about the JS ecosystem.
-   [Coder Radio](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/coderradio/) - Great about the news surrounding the Tech world and about being a developer.
-   [Tech Talk Today](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/today/) - A great way to keep up to date with the news.
-   [5 minutes of JavaScript](https://fivejs.codeschool.com/) - Short episodes with trending subjects about JavaScript.
-   [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) - In the past this was a podcast about .NET and Microsoft related subjects. Today, is less technical and less focused on MS technology, which is not a bad thing. As it tag lines says: "A fresh air for developers".
-   [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) - This is of the most technical one I listen to. A lot of web development and a different point of view on Microsoft technologies.
-   [.NET Rocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/) - Despite the name, the podcast is about a lot of different technologies, but for sure with Microsoft developer in mind.
-   [Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/) - Different subjects for the most programming related.
-   [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) - Another one with different subjects programming related.
-   [Adventures in Angular](https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/) - Well, a podcast about Angular.
-   [WIRED's Gadget Lab](http://www.wired.com/tag/gadget-lab-podcasts/) - Not exactly technical, more about, well, gadgets.

## Board gaming

-   [The Dice Tower](http://www.dicetower.com/game-podcast/dice-tower) - My main source of information about board gaming.
-   [Shut Up & Sit Down](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/podcast/) - A very funny and informative podcast on board gaming.
-   [The Secret Cabal](http://www.thesecretcabal.com/) - Each episode is a little to long for my taste (around three hours), but I liker their opinions.

## Entertainment

-   [The Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/podcasts/nerdist-podcast-channel/) - Interviews and news on geek related stuff.
-   [Nerdcast](http://jovemnerd.com.br/categoria/nerdcast/) - In my opinion still the best Brazilian podcast on different geek subjects. If you speak Portuguese this is a must.
-   [Girl on Guy](http://girlonguy.net/) - It's Aisha Tyler interviewing some personality. It's fun and a good way to relax.
-   [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) - It's just on season, at least for now, but it's great. A very well told story.

## Miscellaneous

-   [SciCast](http://www.scicast.com.br/) - Another one from Brazil, a funny way to learn about science.
-   [Insiders Sports](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/insiders-sports-podcast/id1002925891?mt=2) - I'm an NBA fan, so a podcast about basketball.
