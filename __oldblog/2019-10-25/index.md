The past Thursday I gave a talk at a local React meetup called [Ottawa ReactJS](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-ReactJS-Meetup/). The talk was about how to use Fable, Elmish and F# for a more reliable React application.

The title of the talk was *Reliable React With F#* and you the we [can check out the slides if you'd like](https://templecoding.com/reliable-react-with-fsharp).

The code used for the presentation [can be seen here](https://github.com/thitemple/real-world-fable) and there's also a [live demo available](https://real-world-fable.netlify.com/).
