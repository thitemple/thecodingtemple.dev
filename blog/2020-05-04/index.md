I will be giving (gave) a talk at [React Ottawa](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-ReactJS-Meetup/events/270442672/). The talk is (was) about how to use TypeScript and functional programming practices to better communicate what is the real intentions of the of the code we are writing with the goal of making our lives and of our peers easier when reading that code after a while.

The title of the talk is (was) *Communicating Intention with Functional TypeScript* and you [can check out the slides if you'd like](/communicating-intention-with-functional-typescript/).
