The past Thursday I gave a talk at a local functional programming meetup called [Lambda Nights](https://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Nights/). The talk was about F# and how I believe that it's a viable choice as a main programming language to solve all sorts of problems.

The title of the talk was *F# - Where Functional Programming Meets Pragmatic* and you the we [can check out the slides if you'd like](/fs-pragmatic-presentation).
