			Hello, I'm Thiago Temple, a Brazilian currently residing and working in Ottawa, Canada. You
			can reach me on{" "}

			<SubTitle>What I do?</SubTitle>
			<p>
				I am a staff developer at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, primarily focused on
				programming with web-related technologies.

			<SubTitle>Why I do it?</SubTitle>
			<p>
				My fascination with computers dates back to the 90s, even before my family purchased our
				first computer. At the age of 13, I would utilize my neighbor's computer. Today, I am
				passionate about the art of software development and thrive on the challenge of staying
				updated with the latest technologies. The constant evolution of technology is a major
				driving force for me, along with the knowledge that the software I help build contributes to
				enhancing people's productivity.

			<SubTitle>Why this blog?</SubTitle>
			<p>
				This blog serves as an opportunity for me to practice and reinforce what I am learning. As
				the saying goes, teaching others is one of the most effective ways to solidify one's
				understanding. Or even if I am not teaching anyone, I am documenting for my future self.
				Additionally, I am eager to share the new things I learn and contribute to the community by
				sharing my experiences.
			</p>

			<SubTitle>What I do for fun?</SubTitle>
			<p>
				Living in Canada, I have discovered a new passion due to its harsh winters: board games. I
				now thoroughly enjoy them and have been steadily growing my collection.

					/>
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, I indulge in watching a few{" "}
				<a href="https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/13947508/profile"> TV shows </a>{" "}
				and always have at least one book on the go
			</p>
			<p>
				However, one thing I cherish the most is spending quality time with my family. I am married
				and a proud father of two kids, as well as the owner of two cuddly greyhounds.
