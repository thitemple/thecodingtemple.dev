			As a software engineer based in Ottawa, Canada, I'm passionate about web and mobile
			technologies. I've always been captivated by the ever-evolving world of tech, and I love
			sharing my learning journey on my blog. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me enjoying
			board games, diving into a good book, or spending quality time with my family. It's all about
			balance!

			Outside of the tech world, I have a deep love for board games and have been building a growing
			collection. I'm also a fan of various TV shows and always have at least one book on the go.
			But above all, spending time with my family is my favorite pastime. Life's all about enjoying
			these simple pleasures!
