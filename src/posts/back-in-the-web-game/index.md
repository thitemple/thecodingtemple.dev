summary: After a hiatus, I'm back into web development, excited about the advancements
  in the industry. With ES2015 (ES6), ASP.NET 5, and an array of JavaScript
  libraries, the blog will focus on exploring these technologies and sharing
  insights to assist fellow learners.

So, the last time a posted something on this blog it was almost two years ago.
And, although I kept learning new things during this time, I didn't really feel
like writing.

For one thing, I really took some (long) time to do other things, like, for
instance, I discovered a new hobby that I love: board gaming.

But the main reason is that I was not working (on my daily job) with web
technologies. I've worked some time with BizTalk and for almost two years, with
WPF. And, I may not dislike WPF, but I really don't enjoy it much either. So,
from time to time, I wrote some pet projects to keep myself up-to-date with the
new stuff on web technologies.

Now, I'm back working with web technologies and the moment couldn't be better,
ES2015 was approved, ASP.NET 5 is completely changed, open sourced and is now
multiplatform. Also, every day there's a new JavaScript library being created
(not sure yet if this is a good thing).

So yeah, this is a fun time to be a web developer, especially if you're like me
and love to learn new things!

So what's my plan for this blog? First, I decided to write only in English. For
a while, I wrote both in English and in Portuguese, but it's too much work to
keep doing that, so I decided to drop the version in Portuguese and keep only
the English version.

As for the content, I'll try to dive deep into ES2015 (formally known as ES6),
HTML5 and some new (or not so new) JS frameworks. I hope that can help others
learning the same technologies I'm learning because it will most definitely help
me keep them in my brains if I write it down here.
