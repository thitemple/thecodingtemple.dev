  Nerdist and Serial, there's something for everyone in this eclectic mix.

I have to admit it, I have a serious condition called CPA, AKA Chronicle
Podcasts Addiction, at least I diagnostic myself with that condition.

Yeap, I definitely subscribe to a lot of podcasts. I've just counted my
subscription list, 21. Yes, I subscribe to 21 and I think it's a lot.

I listen to different podcasts on different subjects and so, here I am sharing
what I listen to with you.

## The technical ones:

- [This Developer's Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) - This is definitely
  one of my favorites, a very well produced and interview styled podcast. The
  episodes are not that frequent and not that technical for that matter, but
  they're certainly worth waiting for.
- [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) - If you are a JavaScript
  developer this is a must, a lot of different topics on JavaScript. Great if
  you want to know more about the JS ecosystem.
- [Coder Radio](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/coderradio/) - Great
  about the news surrounding the Tech world and about being a developer.
- [Tech Talk Today](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/today/) - A great
  way to keep up to date with the news.
- [5 minutes of JavaScript](https://fivejs.codeschool.com/) - Short episodes
  with trending subjects about JavaScript.
- [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) - In the past this was a podcast
  about .NET and Microsoft related subjects. Today, is less technical and less
  focused on MS technology, which is not a bad thing. As it tag lines says: "A
  fresh air for developers".
- [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) - This is of the most technical one I
  listen to. A lot of web development and a different point of view on Microsoft
  technologies.
- [.NET Rocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/) - Despite the name, the podcast is about
  a lot of different technologies, but for sure with Microsoft developer in
  mind.
- [Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/) -
  Different subjects for the most programming related.
- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) - Another one with different subjects
  programming related.
- [Adventures in Angular](https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/) - Well, a
  podcast about Angular.
- [WIRED's Gadget Lab](http://www.wired.com/tag/gadget-lab-podcasts/) - Not
  exactly technical, more about, well, gadgets.

## Board gaming

- [The Dice Tower](http://www.dicetower.com/game-podcast/dice-tower) - My main
  source of information about board gaming.
- [Shut Up & Sit Down](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/podcast/) - A very funny
  and informative podcast on board gaming.
- [The Secret Cabal](http://www.thesecretcabal.com/) - Each episode is a little
  to long for my taste (around three hours), but I liker their opinions.

## Entertainment

- [The Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/podcasts/nerdist-podcast-channel/) -
  Interviews and news on geek related stuff.
- [Nerdcast](http://jovemnerd.com.br/categoria/nerdcast/) - In my opinion still
  the best Brazilian podcast on different geek subjects. If you speak Portuguese
  this is a must.
- [Girl on Guy](http://girlonguy.net/) - It's Aisha Tyler interviewing some
  personality. It's fun and a good way to relax.
- [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) - It's just on season, at least for now,
  but it's great. A very well told story.

## Miscellaneous

- [SciCast](http://www.scicast.com.br/) - Another one from Brazil, a funny way
  to learn about science.
- [Insiders Sports](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/insiders-sports-podcast/id1002925891?mt=2) -
  I'm an NBA fan, so a podcast about basketball.
