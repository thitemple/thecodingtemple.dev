Even today, after many TEDs listened and watched, my favorite is still one

Several lessons can be drawn from this video. I could focus on how one became a
Holocaust survivor, or on the way a person decided to deal with someone who was
stealing your stuff and decided to see the best in people, or even how to deal
with cultural differences in the corporate world.

But I'll take the clearest one, that is the final lesson. If two people with so
much knowledge, at the stage of life in which they were found in the story told,
with so much passion for knowledge, no matter what kind of knowledge, why me,
who don't know almost anything about life should act differently?

So there it is, from time to time, I like to watch this video to remind me of
that.
