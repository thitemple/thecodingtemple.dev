  start utilizing ES2015 features today. Level up your JavaScript development
  with ES2015!

So, last June, the
[TC39 Committee](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm) made
EcmaScript 6 a standard. EcmaScript is the official name of the JavaScript
language and the new standard is also known as ES6.

This is already major as news goes, but there's one thing more that's really
important. They decided to call this new version EcmaScript 2015 (or ES2015 for
short). What this means is, they're planning on releasing a new version of
EcmaScript each year. Better yet, the committee is already working on ES2016.

This is a major change since the last two versions of EcmaScript, ES3 and ES5,
were approved in 1999 and 2009 respectively.

For us developers, it's crucial now, more than ever, to keep ourselves
up-to-date with the new features and changes to the language.

## Browser support

What about browser support, you may ask. Well, at the moment of the writing of
this post, the browser that has the most implementations of ES2015 is Firefox
version 41 with 69%. You can check
[this table to see the current status.](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
I can imagine that for most people that's not acceptable if we're talking about
a production environment. So, are there any other options? I'm glad you asked.

## Transpilers

The easiest (and safest) way to start using ES2015 right now is with the use of
transpilers. There are a few in market,
[Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler),
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and even
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is considered a transpiler of ES
with types. I cannot tell you which one is the best, but the one who's gaining a
lot of momentum lately is Babel.

So let's try it with Babel.

I'm assuming you already have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. So next,
we're going to install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

Gulp has a plug-in for Babel that will allow us to transpile the ES2015 files to
ES5 automagically.

In a new folder, create a new package.json file:

```json
{
	"name": "babeldemo",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {},
	"author": "Thiago Temple",
	"devDependencies": {}
}
```

Now let's install gulp to help us transpile our ES2015 code:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-babel
```

Now it's time to configure Gulp. I'm going to do that in a gulpfile.js file
(which is what Gulp expect us to have by default).

```js
var gulp = require("gulp");
var babel = require("gulp-babel");

gulp.task("default", function () {
	return gulp.src("src/app.js").pipe(babel()).pipe(sourcemaps.write(".")).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));
});
```

In this code, we're looking for a file called app.js inside a directory called
_src_. After that, Babel will transpile the file and save an app.js file in the
_dist_ directory. Pretty simple, hum?

Let's say that inside the src\app.js we have the following code:

```js
class Person {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	get name() {
		return this._name;
	}

	set name(name) {
		this._name = name;
	}

	sayHello() {
		return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
	}
}
```

And in the console we run:

```bash
gulp
```

Now, inside the directory _dist_ we should see an _app.js_ file such as:

```javascript
"use strict";

var _createClass = (function () {
	function defineProperties(target, props) {
		for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) {
			var descriptor = props[i];
			descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false;
			descriptor.configurable = true;
			if ("value" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true;
			Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor);
		}
	}
	return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) {
		if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps);
		if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps);
		return Constructor;
	};
})();

function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
	if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
		throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function");
	}
}

var Person = (function () {
	function Person(name) {
		_classCallCheck(this, Person);

		this.name = name;
	}

	_createClass(Person, [
		{
			key: "sayHello",
			value: function sayHello() {
				return "Hello, " + this.name;
			}
		},
		{
			key: "name",
			set: function set(name) {
				this._name = name;
			},
			get: function get() {
				return this._name;
			}
		}
	]);

	return Person;
})();
```

A perfect and valid ES5 file! All we have to do is reference the ES5 transpiled
file inside the HTML files.

What this means is we can start using ES2015 and even some features of ES2016
today to help us build better JavaScript code and that won't have an impact on
our users.

## What if I don't want to use ES2015 in production now?

Honestly, I don't see why not, but if you just want to play with it and get
comfortable, you can do that using the transpiler. But an easier way would be to
use [Babel's repl](https://babeljs.io/repl/). Just type in some ES2015 code and
see the immediate result of the transpilation.

Next, we're going to start seeing the new features in ES2015.
