In the first week of 2017 I changed jobs, I started in a new company after a
little more than three years on my last job. It was not an easy decision to make
because it involved me moving to another city and another province.

But the main reason why it was a tough decision to make was that I really liked
the team I was working with. And that's exactly what I want to talk about. What
makes a good team, at least in my opinion.

We were (when I was there), five developers, one product owner and one person
responsible for quality and I'm proud of have participated in the selection of
all members of the team. But, although I've taken part in the selection of all
members I can't claim that I or others in the team had all that I'm going to say
in mind, I guess this is more of a realization after the fact.

So here are a few of the characteristics of that team that made it really
special and I'd like to point out.

## Constant Challenges

I was the developer with the longest career in the team, but as many people will
say (and I agree), time alone is not enough to make an experience. Because
working so many years doing the same things in the same way it's not growth, you
need to be challenged.

So it's great to have people around you that will constantly challenge your
ideas, be that with other ideas, many times better ideas, or just by asking good
questions.

You don't want a group of people that think the same way all the time.

## The Human Perspective

I am certainly at fault of many times forgetting about the human side of things.
I like the technical aspect of developing software, but for many times I forget
that some actions and/or decisions might not be so well taken by others. So it
is great to have at least someone on your team, that is always worried about the
impact of the team's decisions on people.

## Attention to Details

It is extremely important to have people in the team that have the attention to
details and consequences that some decisions might have.

Do you want to do that big refactoring? Great, the code will definitely be
better after it, but what impacts it might have? Is it really the best moment to
do so? Where should we draw the line of the refactoring?

Same thing when adding new technologies to a project. It's very important to
have people that think about those issues.

## Eager to learn

It's impossible to keep up with everything tech related. There's always new
versions, new frameworks, new languages, new techniques, so it's good to have
different members of the team who are constantly learning and pushing the rest
of the team to learn new things.

## Open minded

I think this is probably the most important characteristic of a great team.
Having members that are open minded. First of all, it's not my team, nor it's
your nor anyone's team. I was there "I did my time, " and I left. The team, the
project and the software will go on.

I'm saying that because it does not have to always be the ideas of one person,
or approved by one person that should be implemented and I'm looking at you
"team leader."

Good teams take in consideration in an equal manner the ideas of every member of
the team.

## Conclusion

So yeah, these are a few takeaways that I have. I'm not saying that I was
working on a perfect team, there's no such a thing. And in every place, there's
always issues. All I'm saying is that I had a great experience there and I hope
I'll live that again on my new team.

What are your takes on what makes a good team?
