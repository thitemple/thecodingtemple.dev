Lately I was made aware by my colleagues that I begin a lot of sentences with
the phrase "I was listening to a podcast..." and that is true. I listen to a lot
of podcasts.

I have shared my
[podcast playlist](/blog/whats-on-my-playlist-podcasts-i-listen-to) before, but
that list has shifted a little bit, so here's my updated list as of the summer
of 2018 in no particular order but grouped by subject - kind of.

## Tech

- [Elm Town](https://www.elmtown.audio/) - A very good source for those
  interested in the Elm language
- [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/) - Every episode a
  different person who does functional programming is interviewed in this show.
- [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/) - Not always technical, and when
  technical it's about a wide range of subjects, in any case it's always very
  interesting.
- [LambdaCast](https://lambdacast.com) - Great for those beginning with
  functional programming, and if that's the case, it's worth listening from the
  beginning.
- [Rework](https://rework.fm/) - From the Basecamp company, who produce a
  [highly recommended book of the same title](https://amzn.to/2LEsFuo), it's a
  podcast about the business of running a tech company.
- [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) - All around web development.
- [Three Devs and a Maybe](http://threedevsandamaybe.com/) - Different subjects
  on development. Very entertaining.
- [WTF#](https://wtfsharp.net/) - It's not updated very often but if you are
  interested in the F# language

## News and varieties

- [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/) - Well, it's the podcast about
  the hidden side of everything.
- [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) - Economics for people who
  are not expert in the subject.
- [Science Vs](https://www.gimletmedia.com/science-vs/) - Each episode is a
  subject being explored in the eyes of science.
- [TED Radio Hour](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour) - You
  know TED right?

## Entertainment

- [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
- [Gugacast](https://gugacast.com/) - This is the funniest one I listen to but
  it's in Portuguese.
- [NerdCast](https://jovemnerd.com.br/nerdcast/) - For years, this was
  considered the best podcast in Brazil. I've been listening to it for about a
  decade.

## Board games

I love board games, I buy a lot of them so here are a couple on the subject.

- [The Dice Tower](https://www.dicetower.com/podcast/dice-tower)
- [The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast](https://www.thesecretcabal.com/)

## Sports

I am a fan of the NBA and specially of the
[Orlando Magic](http://orlandomagic.com), so here's what I listen to keep up to
date with that.

- [Do You Believe in Magic](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/do-you-believe-in-magic/)
- [Locked on Magic](https://www.lockedonmagic.com/)
